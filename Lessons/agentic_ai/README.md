### Key Topics for Agentic AI
To build agentic AI that interacts with multiple models from different vendors, we need to cover:
1. **Python Foundations**: Core skills for AI development.
2. **Machine Learning Basics**: Understanding neural networks and Transformers (the backbone of LLMs).
3. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: How they work, how to use them, and multi-vendor integration.
4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhancing LLMs with external knowledge.
5. **Agent Fundamentals**: Reasoning, tools, and autonomy.
6. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinating multiple models or agents.
7. **Tool Integration**: Connecting agents to APIs, databases, and custom functions.
8. **Memory and Context**: Enabling agents to remember and adapt.
9. **Practical Deployment**: Running agents in real-world scenarios.

### New Curriculum: Building Agentic AI Step-by-Step

This curriculum assumes a part-time effort (5-10 hours/week) and spans ~5-6 months. Each step includes topics, projects, and resources, building toward your goal of creating a multi-vendor agentic AI system.

#### Step 1: Python Foundations for AI

  - Async Programming: `asyncio` for handling multiple API calls (key for multi-vendor agents).
  - Git: Version control for projects.
- **Project**: Write a Python script to fetch and compare responses from two LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI and Hugging Face Hub).
- **Resources**:
  - Real Python tutorials (NumPy, APIs).
  - “Python Crash Course” by Eric Matthes (chapters on data structures and I/O).

#### Step 2: Machine Learning and Transformer Basics
- **Duration**: 3 weeks
- **Topics**:
  - Neural Networks: Layers, weights, backpropagation.
  - Transformers: Attention mechanisms, encoder-decoder architecture.
  - Embeddings: Converting text to vectors (e.g., word2vec, BERT-style).
  - Python ML Tools: `scikit-learn`, `torch` (intro to PyTorch).
- **Project**: Build a simple text classifier with `scikit-learn` or PyTorch to predict sentiment (e.g., positive/negative reviews).

  - Jay Alammar’s “The Illustrated Transformer” (blog + video).

#### Step 3: Mastering Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Duration**: 3 weeks
- **Topics**:
  - LLM Architecture: How GPT, LLaMA, and Claude work (high-level).
  - Using LLMs: Hugging Face `transformers`, vendor APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).
  - Prompt Engineering: Crafting inputs for better outputs.
  - Multi-Vendor Integration: Switching between models dynamically.
- **Project**: Create a Python script using LangChain to generate text with 3 vendors (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Hugging Face’s LLaMA) and compare results.
- **Resources**:
  - Hugging Face “Transformers” docs.
  - LangChain “LLM” module docs (langchain.com).
  - Vendor API guides (e.g., OpenAI API reference).

#### Step 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Duration**: 3 weeks
- **Topics**:
  - Vector Embeddings: SentenceTransformers for text-to-vector conversion.
  - Vector Stores: FAISS, Pinecone for fast retrieval.
  - RAG Workflow: Query → Retrieve → Generate.
  - Multi-Vendor RAG: Testing RAG with different LLMs.
- **Project**: Build a RAG system with LangChain:
  - Store a small dataset (e.g., 10 text files) in FAISS.
  - Query it with two LLMs (e.g., OpenAI and Hugging Face).
- **Resources**:
  - LangChain “Retrieval” docs.
  - “RAG Explained” articles on Medium.
  - SentenceTransformers docs (sbert.net).

#### Step 5: Foundations of Agentic AI
- **Duration**: 3 weeks
- **Topics**:
  - Agent Components: Perception, reasoning, action.
  - Tools: Integrating APIs (e.g., weather, search) and custom Python functions.
  - Reasoning Loops: Plan → Act → Reflect (e.g., ReAct pattern).
  - Frameworks: LangChain’s `AgentExecutor` for agent workflows.
- **Project**: Build a simple agent with LangChain that:
  - Takes a question (e.g., “What’s the capital of France?”).
  - Decides whether to use an LLM or a web search tool.
  - Responds using OpenAI’s GPT.
- **Resources**:
  - LangChain “Agents” docs.
  - “Building AI Agents” tutorials on YouTube.

#### Step 6: Multi-Vendor Agent Design
- **Duration**: 3 weeks
- **Topics**:
  - Model Selection: Dynamically choosing vendors based on task (e.g., Claude for reasoning, GPT for creativity).
  - Toolchains: Combining multiple tools with multi-vendor LLMs.
  - Error Handling: Managing API failures across vendors.
- **Project**: Create an agent that:
  - Uses Anthropic’s Claude to plan a task (e.g., “Summarize recent AI news”).
  - Uses Hugging Face’s model to generate the summary from web data.
- **Resources**:
  - LangChain “Custom Tools” guide.
  - Vendor API docs for error codes.

#### Step 7: Memory and Context for Agents
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Topics**:
  - Short-Term Memory: Conversation history with LangChain’s `ConversationBufferMemory`.
  - Long-Term Memory: Storing insights in a vector store.
  - Context Management: Passing relevant info across vendors.
- **Project**: Enhance your Step 6 agent to:
  - Remember the last 3 questions asked.
  - Use memory to improve responses (e.g., “Follow up on that AI news summary”).
- **Resources**:
  - LangChain “Memory” docs.
  - Blogs on “Contextual AI Agents” (e.g., Towards Data Science).

#### Step 8: Multi-Agent Systems
- **Duration**: 3 weeks
- **Topics**:

  - Frameworks: AutoGen vs. LangChain for multi-agent setups.
  - Inter-Agent Communication: Passing data between models/vendors.
- **Project**: Build a multi-agent system:
  - Agent 1 (Claude): Plans a research task.
  - Agent 2 (GPT): Executes by searching the web.
  - Agent 3 (Hugging Face): Summarizes findings.

  - Scalability: Handling multiple users or tasks.
  - Evaluation: Testing agent performance across vendors.
- **Project**: Deploy your multi-vendor agent as a CLI tool or simple web app (e.g., with Flask) that:
  - Analyzes user-uploaded text.
  - Searches X posts for context (using a mock API or web scraper).
  - Generates a response.
